# STL

C++ STL (standard template library) is a software library for the C++ language that provides a collection of templates representing containers,
iterators, algorithms, and function objects

# What are the benefits of STL?

STL provides programmers to store the data effectively, and do manipulation in stored data.
These are the general-purpose templates of classes and functions that help in implementing the
basic algorithms and data structures like vector, lists, queue, stack, etc
